This directory contains the 6 judgment files used for pilot studies of the
corpus in the summer 2003 SUM papers.

These have preliminary versions of xml-isation, automatic linguistic
annotation, and each has human rhetorical status annotation of one lord's
speech.

Rhetorical status annotation follows the pilot rhetorical scheme. The top-level
version of this hierarchical scheme and the detailed break-down can be viewed
respectively at:
